Transparent Government in Fact (TGIF)

 I was a developer at Code of the Web, a small software shop that creates custom JavaScript-based web applications.
 
 Transparent Government in Fact (TGIF), a non-partisan non-profit organization working to increase 
 the publicâ€™s involvement in government,I developed a Congressional tracking web site for them. 
 
 I worked on this web application using JavaScript, including AJAX, JSON, and RESTful APIs.
